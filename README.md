# Reactive-CRUD-Framework
This is a reactive Rest api framework which can be used for some basic Rest Http api's and can be extended for any modifications.
1.) Completely reactive Application framework.
2.) Totally maintainable and extensible.
3.) Vo layer added over entity layer to provide an extra layer of abstraction.
4.) Dozer Bean Mapper used to maintain the mapping between entity and vo objects.
5.) Since it is a reactive application-framework, it runs on netty-server.
6.) An example package is included to demonstrate how the framework needs to be extended with minimal configurations.
7.) The framework takes care of nearly all the generic work except for the specialized methods which can be extended easily.
